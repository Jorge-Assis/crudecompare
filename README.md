# Crudecompare Dashboard

### Overview

With this project I implemented a dashboard on a Jupyter Notebook to compare crude oil grades traded in the international market.
The used dataset is in the csv file found in the data folder. It is a compilation of 200 different crude oil assays and the Crudecompar Dashboard will focus on
three main parameters, API degree, Sulphur content and Total Acidity Number. More information about the topic is found [here](https://medium.com/@jeyenry/what-are-the-15-most-expensive-crude-oil-in-the-world-part-1-e830ce3a3767).
